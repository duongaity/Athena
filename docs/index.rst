Athena: A system to support (semi-)automated assessment of exercises
======================================================

Athena is a system to support (semi-)automated assessment of exercises.
It connects to an LMS (Learning Management System) and provides endpoints for the LMS for

- sending submissions to Athena
- requesting the best submission to be graded next
- sending existing feedback to Athena
- **requesting suggestions for new feedback to give**

Athena will use the information it is given and provide the automatic suggestions by using sub-modules depending on the exercise type.
